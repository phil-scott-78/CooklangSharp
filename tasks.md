# CooklangSharp Advanced Features Implementation

## Overview
Implementing support for Notes, Sections, and Short-hand preparations in the CooklangSharp parser.

## Tasks

### 1. Domain Model Updates
- [x] Add `NoteItem` class that inherits from `Item` (Changed to NoteContent as SectionContent)
- [x] Add `Note` property to `IngredientItem` for preparation instructions
- [x] Create `Section` class with Name and Content properties
- [x] Create `SectionContent` abstract class for section items
- [x] Update `Recipe` model to use sections instead of flat steps
- [x] Update existing models to work with new structure (Added backward compatibility)

### 2. Parser Implementation

#### 2.1 Note Parsing
- [x] Add `IsNoteLine()` method to detect lines starting with '>'
- [x] Implement `ParseNote()` method to extract note text
- [x] Integrate note parsing into main parsing flow
- [ ] Handle multi-line notes if needed

#### 2.2 Section Parsing
- [x] Add `IsSectionLine()` method to detect section markers
- [x] Implement `ParseSectionHeader()` to extract section names
- [x] Update `ParseRecipe()` to handle sectioned content
- [x] Support various section syntaxes (=, ==, etc.)
- [x] Handle default/unnamed sections

#### 2.3 Ingredient Modifier Parsing
- [x] Update `ParseIngredient()` to check for opening parenthesis after '}'
- [x] Implement parsing of modifier text until closing parenthesis
- [x] Store modifier in the `Note` property of `IngredientItem`
- [x] Handle edge cases (nested parentheses, escaping)

### 3. Integration and Testing
- [ ] Update `ParseResult` if needed for new scenarios
- [x] Create test for note parsing
- [x] Create test for section parsing
- [x] Create test for ingredient modifiers
- [x] Add integration test with the provided example
- [x] Ensure backward compatibility with existing recipes
- [x] Run all existing tests to ensure no regression

### 4. Documentation and Cleanup
- [ ] Update code comments
- [ ] Clean up any temporary code
- [x] Verify all tests pass
- [x] Run build and ensure no warnings

## Progress Notes
- Starting with domain model updates as they form the foundation
- Will implement features incrementally, testing each one
- Keeping backward compatibility in mind throughout

## Completion Summary
- ✅ All domain models updated with support for sections, notes, and ingredient modifiers
- ✅ Parser successfully handles all three new features:
  - Notes (lines starting with '>')
  - Sections (lines with '=' markers)
  - Ingredient modifiers (text in parentheses)
- ✅ Backward compatibility maintained via computed Steps property
- ✅ All 75 tests passing, including new feature tests
- ✅ Implementation matches the expected JSON structure from the specification
